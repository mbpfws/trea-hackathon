ok what's next? At the same time since I need to build 2 sets #

of project rules and user rules (as shown on image) these will have to set rules for AI agents builders know the context, and be accurate on tech stacks and libraries used in the project. The below are some samples I took from similar tech stake so you can consider them as reference for application which used the similar stake

""""


Feel things that I also want to highlight:
- To build the project I will then set different rules and guidelines for front end and back end AI agents so for both user rules and projects rules are set on those that required to get known on overview and common rules and guidelines
- You must use context7 and exa MCP tools to really get down on dependencies, libraries especially ones that related to Schema, or new version old libraries (like google/genai is new but AI builder usually use google/generativeAI etc)
- There are some criteria and challenges from the hackathon that I have shown on the latter 2 images
